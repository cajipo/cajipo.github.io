<h2>About time I create my own website</h2>

    <p> 
        So today, September 30, 2020, I chose Github to handle this site as I create it because I'm 
    too poor to have my own domain, I also don't see the advantages of having a domain just yet. 
    Gonna test the waters first and study every nook 'n cranny of web developing, a g a i n.

<h2>Planning</h2>

    <p> 
        I'm deciding if this should be a personal blog or a tracker of my progress in developing a game. 
    Nevertheless, this would serve 
    as a showcase of what I've learned in web designing first.
    Since I plan on making this a static website for its first few months, I will
    create a CSS too for basic classes so it wouldn't look like a sketchy page from the darkweb. You know what,
    why don't I just go ahead and organize the shit out of this thing right now?

 <p>Notes:
        <ul>
            <li> !DOCTYPE declaration must be placed in the beginning of every HTML document; it informs the browser about the document type.</li>
            <li> Google Style Guide for HTML recommends omitting all optional tags. That includes HTML, HEAD, BODY, P, LI. For file size optimization and scannability purposes.</li>
            <li> When inserting margins and paddings, </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>PHP maybe?</h2>

    <p>
        The header is supposed to be on a different HTML file for reusability purposes, but
        I forgot how to do it. How nice of you memory. As I browse through all the solutions on Stack Overflow, they all 
        mention the use of PHP to tag <?php include?> to do so. Now this may not seem to be a problem, doesn't it? The thing is,
        I only want this site to run on HTML, CSS, and JScript on its first few months. Then I'd add PHP, a simple Database, 
        and some animations by December, so that on 2021, this would look like a functional and aesthetic site. Yes, aesthetics are
        very important to me. To see it the way I imagine it in my head is one of the reasons I like programming. So most likely,
        just another entry for today. Not much update til tomorrow. Will try uploading a PHP file on the header named home.php 
        tho and see if Github accepts it. Gaddamet I'm just feeling lazy.

    <h2>New Found Addiction</h2>

    <p>
        Anyways, Danielle and I are playing Genshin Impact like a bunch of smelly kids at an Internet Cafe. We grind to reach 
        Adventure Rank 16. Only by this level that we are allowed to multiplay and defeat dungeon bosses together. We might try
        it just for the sake of trying. I know she will get ahead of me in terms of progress because she's a very competent woman.
        The story is good, the gameplay is so satisfying, it's overall a good game! I've been looking for this type of game for a
        long time, thank god for Mihoyo and their $100 Million budget to create such a vibrant world and very interesting game that
        is Genshin Impact.
