<h2>About time I create my own website</h2>

    <p> So today, September 30, 2020, I chose Github to handle this site as I create it because I'm 
    too poor to have my own domain, I also don't see the advantages of having a domain just yet. 
    Gonna test the waters first and study every nook 'n cranny of web developing, a g a i n.

<h2>Planning</h2>

    <p> I'm deciding if this should be a personal blog or a tracker of my progress in developing a game. 
    Nevertheless, this would serve 
    as a showcase of what I've learned in web designing first.
    Since I plan on making this a static website, I will convert this into a PHP and go for a modular
    approach. Wherein elements will be called using 'include' tag to reduce code redundancy. Will also
    create a CSS for basic classes so it wouldn't look like a sketchy page from the darkweb. You know what,
    why don't I just go ahead and organize the shit out of this thing right now?

 <p>Notes:
        <ul>
            <li> !DOCTYPE declaration must be placed in the beginning of every HTML document; it informs the browser about the document type.</li>
            <li> Google Style Guide for HTML recommends omitting all optional tags. That includes HTML, HEAD, BODY, P, LI. For file size optimization and scannability purposes.</li>
            <li> When inserting margins and paddings, </li>
