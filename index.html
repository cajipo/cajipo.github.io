<p><h2>About time I create my own website</h2> </p>
<p> So today, September 30, 2020, I chose Github to handle this site as I create it because I'm 
    too poor to have my own domain, 
    I also don't see the advantages of having a domain just yet. 
    Gonna test the waters first and study every nook 'n cranny of web developing, a g a i n.

<p><h2>Planning</h2></p>
<p> I'm deciding if this should be a personal blog or a tracker of my progress in developing a game. 
    Nevertheless, this would serve 
    as a showcase for what I could do in web designing first.
    Since I plan on making this a static website, I will convert this into a PHP and go for a modular
    approach. Wherein elements will be called using 'include' tag to reduce code redundancy. Will also
    create a CSS for basic classes so it wouldn't look like a sketchy page from the darkweb. You know what,
    why don't I just go ahead and organize the shit out of this thing right now?
